Notes related to the data in this spreadsheet,,,,
This worksheet contains three tables. ,,,,
Issues affecting all tables,Note text ,,,
1,"Rounding: estimates are presented both rounded to the nearest hundred and unrounded. Unrounded estimates are published to enable and encourage further calculations and analysis. However, the estimates should not be taken to be accurate to the level of detail provided. More information on the accuracy of the estimates is available in the Quality and Methodology document (QMI).",,,
2,"Small counts: the estimates are produced using a variety of data sources and statistical models, including some statistical disclosure control methods, and small estimates should not be taken to refer to particular individuals.",,,
3,"Usual residence definitions: the estimated resident population of an area includes all those people who usually live there, regardless of nationality. Arriving international migrants are included in the usually resident population if they remain in the UK for at least a year. Emigrants are excluded if they remain outside the UK for at least a year. This is consistent with the United Nations definition of a long-term migrant. Armed forces stationed outside of the UK are excluded. Students are taken to be usually resident at their term time address.",,,
4,"Geography: where subnational level data are presented, the population estimates reflect boundaries in place as of April 2020. The term ""Local Authority District"" or ""LA"" refers to geographical areas in the tables which are below regions and which are not counties or metropolitan counties. In England these include unitary authorities, metropolitan districts, non-metropolitan districts and London boroughs. In Wales they are known as unitary authorities, in Scotland as council districts and in Northern Ireland as local government districts. Further information can be found in the 'geography guide' worksheet ",,,
5,"Two boundary sets: In April 2021, changes were made to the administrative geography of the UK. This spreadsheet uses the boundaries after that point, which are the bodies that existed at publication. An accompanying version presents data on the boundaries before that point i.e. for the bodies that existed at the data reference period.",,,

6,"Internal migration is defined as residential moves between different local authority districts (LAs) in the UK, including those that cross the boundaries between the four UK nations: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Internal migration figures for Northern Ireland include flows to and from the Isle of Man. This means that net internal migration at UK level will not sum to zero.",,,
7,"Other changes presented in this table comprise changes to the size of armed forces stationed in the UK and other special population adjustments. At geographies higher than local authority, adjustments due to rounding may also be included. This means that other changes at local authority level may not sum to other changes at national level.",,,
Issues affecting table MYE5,Note text ,,,
8,Rounding: the population density estimates and area measurements are displayed rounded to the nearest integer though calculations have been performed on the unrounded data.,,,
9,"Definitions: Standard Area Measurements (SAM) data used reflect the position as at 31 December 2020. Land area measurements, excluding inland water, have been used in compiling these population density figures. Information on this is available from the ONS geography portal",,,
10,"Changes: the area measurements are a definitive set derived from boundaries maintained by Ordnance Survey and Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland. The current measurements may differ from those published previously in tables, publications, or other statistical outputs, even allowing for boundary changes or changes to the physical structure of the land because of improvements to the source of the data.",,,
